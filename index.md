# Judges in Israel - Mini Project in Digital Humanities

## About the Project
In this project we decided to address a topic that interested us, and have been in public's interest in the recent years.
What are the characteristics of people in key positions in Israel. 
In our project we decided to focus on the judicial system - judges.

## How we did it?
1. We found a reliable source that contains valid information about serving judges in Israel.
2. Using a scrapper we created, we extracted information about the judges from the source.
3. We wrote a Pyhton script that extracts and manipultates the raw data and stores in a JSON in a structure defined by us.
4. We present here the data about judges in Israel that we have collected.
